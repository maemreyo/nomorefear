    ❓ Question:
        =>> Given an array of integers arr[], The task is to find the index of first repeating element in it i.e. the element that occurs more than once and whose index of the first occurrence is the smallest. 

    🚀 Expected Complexities:
        ⌛ Time complexity: O(n) or O(n^2)
        🌌 Space complexity: O(1) or O(n)

    🗳️ Example:
        Input: arr[] = {10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}
        Output: 5 
        Explanation: 5 is the first element that repeats

        Input: arr[] = {6, 10, 5, 4, 9, 120, 4, 6, 10}
        Output: 6 
        Explanation: 6 is the first element that repeats

    🙌🏻 Approach:
        =>> Approach 1:
        -
