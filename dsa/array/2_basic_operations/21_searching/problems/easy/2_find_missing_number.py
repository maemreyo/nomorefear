    ❓ Question:
        =>> Given an array arr[] of size n-1 with integers in the range [1, n], the tash is to find the missing number from the first n integers. Assume there are no duplicated in the list.

    🚀 Expected Complexities:
        ⌛ Time complexity: O(n)
        🌌 Space complexity: O(1)

    🗳️ Example:
        Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 8]
        Output: 5
        Explanation: Here the size of the array is 7, so the range will be [1, 8]. The missing number between 1 to 8 is 5
        
        Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: Here the size of the array is 4, so the range will be [1, 5]. The missing number between 1 to 5 is 4
